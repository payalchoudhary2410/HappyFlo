# HappyFlo

Your complete partner to cope mental stress and mood swings during periods! Elevate your mental health with HappieFlo!

## Inspiration
Women experience menstruation every month. It's often common to have mood swings and bad mental health during mensuration, which usually leads to women underperforming during that phase. They tend to have irritable moods which leads to inefficient work and less productivity.

## What it does
HappieFlo helps the user track their mood throughout the periods by taking surveys at random times to compute an overall index for the mood and mental health. It also makes a comparison of the mental health month-wise and gives updates if the user is handling the mood swings better or worse than previous months. HappieFlo gives suggestions and links to get various things that can be helpful in uplifting the mood of the user (including, song suggestions based on the current mood of the user). It also helps them in tracking their periods, thus helping them handle the Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
